////stretch features / features to be added:////

auth. at the moment, users have to manually input their name and score. if i made a login system, the form would already have their names inputted into the form. along with the potential to keep track of each users highest score and only let them post on the leaderboard when their highest score changes

pop up form on loss. at the moment, users have to navigate to the leaderboard and manually input the name and score. a pop up form will be added to auto inout the score to there is no "trust system" on the score

sorting the leaderboard by highest to lowest score. 

////challanges:////

react use state updates are slow. working with use state while making a game was very annoying. useEffect was a great work around so that code that relies on state to update first doesnt run until it updates. 

////post project thoughts:////

getting everything done before the due date was definately a bit overwhelming, but also very rewarding. i thought i would do well really testing myself, all the knowledge ive gotten up until now, and my ability to research and learn new methods. which i did and i am very proud of myself. this project really made me feel like a real software developer.
